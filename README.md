# FPL-Table-Calculation

Being an enthusiastic participant in the English Premier Leagues Fantasy PL game for the past 5 years, and having just begun my journey with Python, I have created a simple table calculator.

It can calculate tables from any particular period, and is quite useful for Money League calculations where hits are not taken into account on the monthly tables on the site.

Just enter the league coden the calling function, which is available on the site's url when you click on the league, and enter the starting and ending points of the period you wish to calculate a table for.

[P.S - Numbers on the left indicate overall rank]
